              <p> I and a couple of my friends came together to brainsorm and figured out there had to be a central repository where problems would be listed out so problem solvers who want to do something but dont know what to do or where to start could just visit and immediately find something they connect to and do it. Thus making this world a better place.<a href="https://uncooloj.github.io/bounty-hackathon/">here</a></p>
